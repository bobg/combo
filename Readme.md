# Combo - combinatorial operations for Go

This is combo,
a library of combinatorial operations for Go.
Given a slice,
it can compute its permutations,
its n-element combinations,
and its n-element combinations-with-replacement.

Please see the documentation at [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bobg/combo).
